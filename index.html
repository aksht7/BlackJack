                points: [
                    "<strong>Acclimatization:</strong> This is paramount. Follow the itinerary's gradual ascent and allow for rest in Leh. Drink plenty of water (3-4 liters daily), avoid alcohol and smoking, and listen to your body. Ascend slowly. Carry basic medicines for AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness) like Diamox (consult your doctor first).",
                    "<strong>Permits:</strong> Indian nationals typically need an Inner Line Permit (ILP) for Nubra Valley, Pangong Tso, Tso Moriri, etc. Foreign nationals require a Protected Area Permit (PAP). These can be obtained online or through travel agents in Leh. Carry multiple photocopies.",
                    "<strong>Road Conditions:</strong> The Manali-Leh Highway is challenging. Roads can be rough, unpaved, and involve water crossings (nalas). Landslides are possible, especially during monsoon (July-August). Always check the latest road status. A 4x4 vehicle or a high-ground clearance vehicle (SUV) is highly recommended. Drive slowly and carefully.",
                    "<strong>Vehicle Preparation:</strong> Ensure your vehicle is in excellent condition. Check tires (including spare), brakes, engine oil, coolant. Carry a basic toolkit, puncture repair kit, and tow rope.",
                    "<strong>Fuel:</strong> Fuel stations are scarce. Refuel whenever possible (Mandi, Manali, Keylong, Leh). Carry extra fuel in jerry cans if your vehicle has low mileage or for remote routes like Nubra-Pangong direct.",
                    "<strong>Best Time to Travel:</strong> June to September is generally the best time, when passes are open and weather is relatively stable. July and August might see some monsoon effects on the Manali side.",
                    "<strong>Accommodation:</strong> Options range from hotels in towns like Manali and Leh to basic guesthouses and tented camps in places like Jispa, Sarchu, Pang, and near Pangong Tso. Book in advance during peak season.",
                    "<strong>Communication:</strong> Mobile connectivity is limited. Postpaid BSNL, Airtel, and Jio connections work in Leh and some other areas. Data connectivity is often slow. Inform your family about your itinerary.",
                    "<strong>Essentials to Carry:</strong> Warm clothing (layers are key: thermals, fleece, windproof jacket, woolen cap, gloves), rain gear, sturdy waterproof trekking shoes, first-aid kit (band-aids, antiseptic, pain relievers, motion sickness tabs, medication for AMS), sunscreen (SPF 30+), sunglasses (UV protection), lip balm, power bank, torch/headlamp, snacks (energy bars, dry fruits, chocolates), water bottles (reusable), cash (ATMs are limited outside Leh and Manali).",
                    "<strong>Respect Local Culture:</strong> Ladakh has a rich Buddhist culture. Dress modestly when visiting monasteries, ask for permission before taking photographs of people or inside monasteries. Be mindful of local customs.",
